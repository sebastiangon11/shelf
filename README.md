Shelf is a super dynamic Note-taking application build on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs).<br />

Shelf is always available with a customizable shortcut. This allows you to take your notes without losing focus or having to change screens and lose your time. <br />
You also get clipboard history out of the box.
